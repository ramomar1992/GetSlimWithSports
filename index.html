        <h2 style="color:blueviolet;">Why sport is important for YOU</h2>
        <P>
            Engaging in sport has many benefits, and it’s not all physical. When it comes to kids, engaging in sport can help to <br>
            create habits and health benefits that last long into adulthood. <br><br><br>
            According to Australia’s Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines children aged 5–12 years should accumulateAccording<br>
             to Australia’s Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines children aged 5–12 years should accumulate at least 60 minutes of <br>
             moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity every day. Some of this will occur at school each day, but it’s important to remember that<br>
              the more physical activity kids engage in the better.<br><br>
            at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity every day. Some of this will occur at school<br>
            each day, but it’s important to remember that the more physical activity kids engage in the better.<br>
        </P>
        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">The physical benefits of sport</h3>
        <p>Keeping active through physical activity and sport has many benefits for the body. Some of these benefits include<br>
        increased cardiovascular fitness, bone health, decreased risk of obesity, improved sleep, and better coordination and<br>
        balance.<br><br>
        
        Reducing the amount of time spent in sedentary activities such as watching TV or playing computer games is also<br>
        recommended and can be just as important as increasing physical activity. Setting time limits for your kids when it<br>
        comes to sedentary activities can help with this.</p>
        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">Learning important life skills</h3>
        <p>Engaging in sport is important for more than just physical fitness. Playing sport often means being part of a team and<br>
        this allows for building skills in a whole range of areas. As well as learning all of the techniques involved in the<br>
        sport, children can also develop their life skills. Playing team sports encourages cooperation and sharing, resilience,<br>
        goal setting and building relationships. Learning to lose is also an important skill that’s often uncovered through
        playing sport.</p>
        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">Be a role model</h3>
        <p>Parents can encourage their kids to play sport in many ways, including through role modelling. It’s not just parents and<br>
        carers that are role models for children though. Kids often look to teachers, sports coaches and before and after school<br>
        care employees to be inspired and encouraged when it comes to sport.<br><br>
        
        Keeping active is a skill for life. Active kids are more likely to become active adults so encourage your kids to get<br>
        involved in physical activity and sport from a young age and ensure you’re being a role model when it comes to sport.</p>
        <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">Find your team</h3>
        <p>Kids can find their sporting team through their local school, sports centre, holiday program or before and after school</h3></h3>
        care service. Trying out a range of different sports can help your child find one that suits them. Make sure your child</h3>
        has plenty of opportunity to try activities out before settling on one.</h3></h3>
        
        Sport has many benefits for kids. It improves physical fitness, teaches important life skills and increases the chances</h3>
        they will become active adults. Be a role model and encourage your children to get active as much as possible.</p>
